    <h3>What was the problem?</h3>
        <p>I had a lot of problems in the middle of the sprint( in the kata after the gradebook). I was getting stuck again and again. I later realized that I had a pattern in these problems. 
      I was trying to rush into writing code as I was running late, but this did not help me. Was getting too many errors, and overall logic of the code did not make sense.
      Then I realized that I am not following any structure, I was trying to solve the question directly without putting my thoughts together.
      </p>

    <h3>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>After a lot of frustration, I reminded myself to slow down and to use all the techniques, mainly pseudocode, console.log, taking time to read and understand errors, and the rubber ducky method.
      I also read the question multiple times, read the hints, and made an outline of it. What should I first take the input to do that question, then what should be its output and what logic to apply to get that output? 
      </p>

    <h3>how did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>I had a lot of trouble and felt anxious and frustrated in the middle, but I had to change my habit. Repeatedly I had to convince myself that I have to follow the steps, stay calm, and stay positive. Initially, it was difficult to write pseudocode because I had to change the steps again and again to write each step in sequence but as I started following the steps one by one, the problem got solved, and I felt better. 
      </p>
    <h3>what did you learn?</h3>
      <p>I think that to solve any problem, first, we should read the question properly, understand the input and output, make a structure of that problem or divide it into small parts, use console logging frequently, so that if we face some problem in any step then we can see it easily in the console.
      </p>

      <h2>Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you elegantly solved a problem.</h2>

    <h3>what was the problem?</h3>
      <p>I think I was elegant in kata's fizzbuzz exercise, I solved it well without issues. 
      </p>
      
    <h3>what problem-solving techniques did you use?</h3>
      <p>This time, after seeing the problem, I could easily think of the pseudocode, then I used the rubber ducky method to explain it to    myself. And console logging to check on arrays and values passed.
       I could easily understand how to check a number conditionally and return the correct string. It was also easy to iterate the array from the for loop by calling fizzbuzz's element on each element of the array and creating a function that takes the strings 3,5 and 15 in an appropriate manner.
      </p>

    <h3>how did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
      <p>I felt satisfied because till this point I could recall loops and functions easily.
      </p>
      
    <h3>what did you learn?</h3>
      <p>New thing for me in this exercise was to use structured thinking to solve problems. But the best thing was to use console.log to check the outputs while coding, so that mistakes dont happen.
      </p>

    <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>
      <p>Here is my confidence level if i mark it on a scale of 0-10:
        <ul>
          <li>Pseudocode - 7/10</li>
          <li>Trying something - 6/10</li>
          <li>Rubber ducky method - 7/10</li>
          <li>Reading error messages - 6/10</li>
          <li>Console.logging - 8/10</li>
          <li>Googling - 8/10</li>
          <li>Asking your peers for help - 3/10</li>
          <li>Asking coaches for help - 3/10</li>
          <li>Improving your process with reflection - 7/10</li>
        </ul>
