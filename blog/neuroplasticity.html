    <h2 class="font">Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.</h2>
    <p>This is a process in our brain that is responsible for changing our brain as we learn new things and get into new situations. Brain plasticity greatly builds our ability to adapt to changing conditions, as it helps to deal with many new problems that we have not faced before.</p>
    <p>The best way to manage neuroplasticity is through controlling our behavior. If we keep positive behavior, then it can not just help us adapt to new environments, but can even cure a disease like stroke or any injury to the brain, it can control and cope with issues like fear, anxiety, apathy, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.
    </p>

    <h2>Discuss how you can combine the principles of neuroplasticity to your advantage.</h2>
    <p>I am doing this course now, which is 12 years after I completed my graduation, and big life changes in the last 12 years. After so much time when I thought about learning new things, I thought that maybe I would not be able to do it, maybe I will not understand. I had many questions in my mind, but after knowing about neuroplasticity, now it seems that by being positive in my thoughts, practicing again and again, I can do anything.Frustration and pain is normal while learning new things, it just means that my brain cells are working very hard to learn these new things &#128512;<br>
      <br>
    Overall I am confident that if I keep on trying like this then I can learn well and become efficient in my work and keep up to this course's demands, and also continue to apply these learnings throughout my career.</p>

    <h2>What are some ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>
    <p>With a little time and patience, we can rewire our brains, which can help with anxiety and frustrations.
      Challenging our brain regularly can help improve cognitive function. Due to this, the brain is forced to work harder, which can improve memory and we can understand things better, for this we can do some brain exercises like:
      <ol>
        <li> Develop New Skills - Learning a new skill can improve memory function and it can also strengthen connections in the brain. The interesting thing is that when you teach something to someone else it also enhances your learning ability because you need to practice it yourself. This will come naturally in this course.</li>
        <li>Learning a new language - Learning more than one language is not only good for the personality but also for the brain. Learning a new language improves memory, increases creativity, and improves visual-spatial skills function.</li>
        <li> Involve all your senses - When you do any work, use all your senses. This helps in making your brain strong.</li>
        <li> Listen to Music - Listening to songs can improve creative thinking, improve brain function as well as help to come up with new solutions.</li>
        <li> Teach someone else a new skill - The best way to enhance your learning is to teach a new skill to someone else. After learning any new skill, you need to practice it. When you teach it to someone else, you repeat the whole concept so that you learn it better and your brain learns it better.</li>
        <li> Meditate - Daily meditation can help calm the mind, slow breathing, and help reduce stress and anxiety, as well as help, fine-tune memory and the brain's information process can increase capacity.</li>
    </ol>

  <h1 class="heading">Growth Mindset</h1>

  <h2> Discuss what Growth Mindset is and why it is relevant.</h2>
  <p>The Growth Mindset teaches that our intelligence, creativity, and athleticism are not fixed and innate traits, but rather learned skills that can be improved through persistence, effort, taking on new challenges, and learning from mistakes.The term refers to a state of mind in which people believe that their abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.This principle is the beginning of the intellect and talent that drives a person to fulfill his desires and achieve his goals. A growth mindset is a continuous effort to learn something, which is the key to accomplishing great things in life.A growth mindset is different from a fixed mindset. A person with a fixed mindset has lost confidence in their ability to learn and improve over time. Therefore, people adopting a growth mindset should be aware that this principle takes time to bear fruit.
  </p>
  <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
  <p>This thinking(Growth mindset) is already close to my values, these are the same things that we teach our kids so it was not a surprise rather it is a reminder to me and very relevant to my current situation. By using this thinking, I can learn new skills in a disciplined way.<br>
    The main change for me is that  I will use this thinking practically in my daily life to help me improve every day. I have to now apply these principles.
    </p>
  
    <h2>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
    <p>I will upskill myself and envision a future where I am more skilled than in the present and am already ready to work harder, and I know it will boost my confidence too.I will learn with even more effort and dedication to complete this course. This approach will automatically improve the quality of my inputs, and also positively affect the output. I will try to develop patience and perseverance, as a growth mindset can help in self-improvement and make me stronger to face challenges. I will remind myself that it takes time to develop skills, and results can only be seen by being consistent and disciplined.

    <h1 class="heading"> How these understandings shape my learning plan and strategy</h1>
    <p>After knowing the Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset, I have now come to know that whenever I was having trouble understanding a topic while doing this course, it is natural and it happens whenever we learn something new. Now, I am feeling very confident because now I feel that I am ready to step out of my comfort zone and take on new challenges and learn something new and enjoy it.<br>
      Earlier I used to be afraid of failing if I try something new, but now I have come to know that there is nothing wrong with it. We learn something only after making a mistake. When we learn after making a mistake, then our confidence increases. Now I will focus on my efforts more than my result and I am sure that the result will come automatically.
