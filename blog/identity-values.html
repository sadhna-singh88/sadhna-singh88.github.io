    <h1 class="heading">My Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>
    <section><p>On thinking about values I find that values have helped shape my life, they have guided me in difficult times and influenced my decisions. I think over time values make us who we are, it defines our identity.</p></section>

    <h2>Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values and identity?</h2>
    <p>Indian culture has played an important role in my life. My culture teaches me how to live with harmony and kindness, and how to get along with everyone. I have learned to accept the way things are and maintain focus on improvements. I believe that our actions  affect our current and  future life and their effects, good or bad, always come back to us(law of karma).
    Family and community are a very important consideration of every decision that I take. If i talk about people in my life who influenced me they are two people: My mother has a big influence in my life. She taught me how to be religious and never give up on values, and my husband who always stands firm with me and inspires me to never give up and encourages me to believe in myself.</p>


    <h2>Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey?</h2>
   <p>I am very hardworking and don't give up easily. I am always ready to learn new things. Always ready to improve myself. I am also disciplined and don't get distracted. I think these qualities will help me to succeed in my learning journing in Dev Academy and in life in general.</p>


  <h2>Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development. How might these affect your learning journey?</h2>
   <p>As I am a beginner, getting things done on time is challenging, I need a lot of time to read and practice, but I am able to give additional time with support from my family.
    Also, talking about limitations, I feel that I am not able to explain myself well for core as this approach is new for me I am not used to it, but I am trying my best to make it work, and I am sure that by practicing more, I will overcome this limit during this course.</p>

  <h2>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why?</h2>
  <p>This has not happened to me before but if it happens in future then I will listen carefully to that person's point of view and also try to explain my point of view based on my observation or knowledge, so that a mutually agreed solution can come out of our conversations. In such situations it's important to not let ego get in the way of healthy conversation.</p>
