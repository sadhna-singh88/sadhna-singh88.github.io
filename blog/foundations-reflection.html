    <h2 class="font"> What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
       Core has helped me a lot while doing this course. From core I came to know that difficulty in learning new things is natural and by keeping myself positive, I can overcome all challenges. Core made it easier for me to remind myself of my <em><strong>values</strong> ​​and <strong>strengths.</strong></em> I learned about <strong>neuroplasticity</strong> and how we can train our brains from working and thinking about work to problem-solving. Now, I am feeling confident because I feel that I am ready to step out of my comfort zone and take on new challenges and learn something new and enjoy it.

    <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Values</strong> ​​help us to take the right decision, they are our guiding principle which is very important for life.<br>
        <strong> Empathy </strong>helps us to better understand other people, we can communicate well with them, which is necessary to work in a team environment.<br>
        <strong>Self-Awareness</strong> is very important for learning, we should be self-aware so that we know what habits we want to change, what mistakes we might have done, and what solutions are available to us, it helps us to plan ahead and plan well. 
      </p>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Overall knowing all different aspects and skills for IT jobs was itself a surprise for me because before this course there was only one impression in my mind that only technical knowledge is required. Whereas now I know and realised that working with other people is big part of the job, it is equally important to have core skills along with tech knowledge.
      </p>

    <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
      <p>
        Thinking about every task, reflecting, blogging, and communicating my thoughts about all work done is a new concept to me, I was not used to thinking so much, and hence core parts and reflections are very challenging. I am practicing and trying to improve on this every day. I am also very conscious that I may do these wrong, so I take my time.
        I understand that these skills are very important for professional life, so I am happy that I am learning these, hopefully, I will improve and get comfortable as I progress.

    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development      Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
      <p>
        I think Core is taught in this course because after all, in a company, we have to work with people and we have to solve the problems for the people(with our apps and solutions), interact with people, understand their points, and tell them our view. Getting better at all these will help in the IT job. <br>
        After using Core, I feel positive that knowing about all this will help me a lot in adjusting myself to the new environment.
      </p>

    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
      <p> 
        Core learning is not a waste of time for me at all, it is very important to learn these skills. I never thought about all these things and now i feel it has a lot of value in the environment in which I am going to work.<br>
        Earlier I used to think that in web development it is enough just to have the knowledge of tech, it is equally important to have core skills so that you can work in a team with other people. We can create better apps if we know how users of our app think and feel, it can make easy to work in a team and improve my communcation.
