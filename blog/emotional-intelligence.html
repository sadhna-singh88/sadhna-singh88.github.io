      What is Emotional Intelligence?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is an ability by which we can understand and manage the emotions and feelings of ourselves and others. How much emotional intelligence we have depends on the quality of our relationships, how we manage our stress in everyday work, and how well we can talk with people. We should know how to manage our positive and negative emotions.<br>
      <br>
      <em><strong> EQ mainly covers 5 things:</strong></em>
      <ol>
      <li>Self-Awareness - How aware are you not only of knowledge but also of social emotion.</li>
      <li>Self-regulation - It refers to how you use the emotions that you have got from experience in your work.</li>
      <li>Empathy  - This is the condition in which you think about what others are thinking about you.</li>
      <li>Social Skills - Those skills or our body language by which we talk to others, we express our thoughts.</li>
      <li>Motivation - This principle tells us that taking our action is not dependent on motivation, but it is definitely dependent on the reason for motivation. If we start taking action, then the motivation will increase even more.</li>
      </ol>

    <h2>
      How EQ is different from IQ?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Where IQ measures how people read, understand, and apply that knowledge, the same EQ measures how a person learns, understands, and applies emotional knowledge.EQ shows how a person understands his and others' emotions. It affects your behavior and the actions you are taking. EQ is flexible. It does not depend on age like it.IQ decreases with increasing age after a limit whereas EQ increases with age.Both serve as the basis of each other. Where IQ gives better performance in life, EQ gives better ideas.

    <h2>
      Why EQ is important?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The way we react to our emotions, those small reactions affect our life, so by developing EQ, we can become good in health, relationships, and work in our life. Our mental health reflects our emotional life. How to manage any stress in our everyday life, which in both small and big ways, decides how our mental health will be. If we satisfy the emotional needs of our friends, family members, or those we love and react well to their emotions, then it means we are attracting good health and good relations in our life.
