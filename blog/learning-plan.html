      <h1> Learning-Plan</h1>
      <h2 class="font">What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
     <p>I have always been fascinated by changing technologies and enjoy using them. Now I want to learn how these technologies work,  go deeper into programming and build a career as a full stack developer. Building impactful Apps and Websites that help a lot of people and businesses is one of my dreams. Knowing that many thousands of people will use what I have built will be very satisfying.</p>
       <h2>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h2>
     <p>I am always keen to learn and have a can-do attitude. I am not afraid to take challenges that help me improve. I am sure these strengths will help me to move ahead and overcome problems.
     Sometimes, time can be a limitation because as a beginner I need a lot of time to read and practice, but I am able to take help and support from family to overcome this.
     Also, talking about limitations, in the core part I feel that I am not able to explain myself well as this approach is new for me, I am not used to it, but I am trying my best to make it work, and I am sure that by practicing more, I will overcome this limit during this course.</p>

    <h2>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h2>
    <p>I would like to develop both the skills. I think that in any field as a beginner, one must have both of these skills so that one can do that work with any group or alone, and express themselves in a better way.</p>

   <h2>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h2> 
   <p>I will follow a disciplined approach to manage my work. I am already following a schedule and trying to ensure that I get quality time without distractions.In my perspective when we work in groups, listening to everyone is a key, this enables us to work in a better way. In a group we need to observe other learnerâ€™s approaches, learn from them or give feedback on any topic. It is also necessary to give respect to the point of view of other people in a group.I will try my best not to become a pile of work, but if it happens, I will spend additional time and effort in completing that work. I would like to keep a daily track of my progress so that I don't fall behind, or I am alerted soon if I have to catch up.</p> 
 
  <h2>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h2>
  <p>I try to read the material carefully, look for examples to understand the concept. But if I am still stuck for long, I will take help from my team and facilitators.<p>

  <h2>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h2>
  <p>If I am stuck and do not understand any task or challenge, then will look up to the facilitator to help me by providing pointers or explaining the concepts</p>

  <h2>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h2>
  <p>No,I don't have any major commitments, my husband is able to help me out. I just have to make sure that we have food at my house &#128512;</p>
